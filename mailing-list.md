Our mailing lists are hosted by Google Groups.  We have one list for the players in the annual Geekend events, and lists for each of the groups that meet regularly to game.

You can access the groups on the web here:

**Remember**, you can only post to the mailing lists from the email address that you have registered with each list.  If you try posting with another address, you should receive a bounce message.

**Also Remember** to check your junk mail box for messages from *@geekend-pnw.com.  Add the list addresses to your contacts in email, that is usually a good way to avoid having our messages land in your spam folder.
