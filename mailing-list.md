**Remember**, you can only post to the mailing lists from the email address that you have registered with each list.  If you try posting with another address, you should receive a bounce message.

**Also Remember** to check your junk mail box for messages from *@geekend-pnw.com.  Add the list addresses to your contacts in email, that is usually a good way to avoid having our messages land in your spam folder.
