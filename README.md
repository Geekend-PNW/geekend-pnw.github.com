## About

This is the website for geekend-pnw.com

## Editing

The site is generated by jekyll, so if you want to be able to generate content on your local machine you will need to set up jekyll

## Updating pages

You can update pages using the built in text editing functions in GitHub.

To create a new event, create a new file with the name `<year>-<month>-<event name>.md` in `/events`.  It will beed to have the following frontmatter block:

```
---
title: "<EVENT TITLE>"
event_id: <year>-<month>
---
```


Build out the page, use other events to understand how thig get put together.

The games, participants and schedules sections should come from `include` files... which in turn draw from the `/_data` directory.  To edit these sections, add the include command `{% include game-list.md %}` and then go to `/_data` and edit the associated data file.

the `event_id` in the frontmatter is the key for linking players, games and schedules to an event.
