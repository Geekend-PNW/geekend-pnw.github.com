Geekend is just a bunch of guys who really like role playing games (RPGs.)  We get together once a year for a weekend to play games, drink beer, hang out, and catch up.  Most of what we do occurs in person or via mailing lists.  This is just a place we use to organize ourselves and to record past events.
